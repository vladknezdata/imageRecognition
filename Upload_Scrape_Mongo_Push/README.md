# Project_3
Objective:
Image Recognition using Mask_RCNN Machine Learning Algoirthm. 

Build an interactive UI/application using Python Flask/Pandas/Numpy, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, Javascript, MS Coco database, Mask_RCNN model, Heroku.

Steps:
a. Upload the image in the UI, and display the raw image in the UI

b. Store the raw image in the DB

c. Use Mask_RCNN model to process and identify the object using MS Coco database and determine if the image can be identified (classified) and masked; otherwise pass a message stating 'Image cannot be recognized'

d. Display the processed/Masked image in the UI

e. Possibly Store the Masked image in Mongo DB (possibly constrained by free space available for use on MongoDB )

f. Upload videos and split the video into multiple frames/photos

g. Repeat steps a-e above

<!--Determining the Relationship betweent Uber Demand and the Weather (NYC)-->

<!--This project aims to determine the relationship between Uber ride demand and the historical weather. The team predicts that riderhsip will increase dramatically under less-than-ideal conditions (rain, snow).-->

<!--Reach Goal: Compare demand and weather to average subway ridership and locations per day-->
